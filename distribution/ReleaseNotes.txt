Release Notes

HEAD, planned as v0.13
- Added a barrel shifter (thanks to roy77)
- In case of oscillations almost all affected components are shown.
- If an error occurs, the name of the affected circuit file is shown.
- An input can have "high z" value as its default value.
  CAUTION: All inputs have lost their default values! If you have build a circuit that
           contains test cases that depend on a non-null default value, this tests
           will fail. To resolve this issue, reset the default value.
- Added an enable input to the T flip-flop
  CAUTION: By default this input is activated now. In circuits which used the T flip-flop
           in the past, the new input needs to be disabled.
- A warning message shows up if a circuit with unnamed inputs is analysed.
- A warning message shows up if a circuit with missing pin numbers is exported to a
  hardware-related file.
- Unidirectional FETs are added to overcome certain CMOS issues.
- Comments are allowed in hex files.
- Added zooming to measurement graphs.
- Test results can be displayed as measurement graphs.
- The Text component is able to show multiple lines.

v0.12.1, released on 05. Jun 2016
- added a fuse to simulate a PROM or PAL.
- added some more CMOS examples
- Improved flexibility of the splitter.

v0.12, released on 02. Jun 2016
- Added undo/redo functions.
- New wire drawing mode: If a wire is added it is rectangular by default.
  In rectangular mode "F" flips the wire and pressing "D" switches to diagonal mode.
- Added inverted inputs for basic gates and flip-flops.
- Added a locked mode, which avoids the unwanted modification of the circuit.
- Better support for high dpi screens.
- Added DIL packages to allow more "physical" circuits. See examples/74xx.
  Up to now only a view 74xx circuits are available.
- Added a pin number attribute to inputs and outputs.
- Add some functions to make it easier to create 74xx circuits.
- Lots of small usability improvements.
- Added a list of keyboard shortcuts to the documentation.

v0.11.1, released on 02. May 2017
- Added the possibility to open a circuit from the command line.
- The backspace key works like the delete key.
- Avoid extreme long lines in the error message dialog.
- Some minor bug fixes.

v0.11, released on 20. Apr 2017
- Added floating gate FETs.
- Better detecting of missing signals in test cases.
- Better plausibility checks if diodes are used.
- Added a loop command to the test data parser.
  See "cmos/sram.dig" as an example usage of the new loop statement.

v0.10, released on 09. Apr 2017
- User can select the expressions representation format in the settings dialog.
- Better formatting of minimized expressions.
- Easier editing of truth tables
- Mouse actions can be canceled by the ESC key.
- With CTRL + mouse button you can now select and move/delete wires.
- Added a real bidirectional switch and a relay.
- Added N and P channel FETs and some CMOS examples, including a 16 bit SRAM
- Added a rotary encoder
- Added a LED matrix display
- Improved and documented the file import strategy.
- Added a tree view to insert components.
- Added support for the ATF1502 and ATF1504 CPLDs.
- some minor bug fixes

v0.9, released on 03. Feb 2017
- improved documentation
- moved "show listing" functions to the assembly IDE.
- rearrangement of the components in the components menu
- made "don't care" as test case input values functional
- added a better test data parser which supports a "repeat([n])" statement.
  See the "combinatorial/FullAdderCLA.dig" as an example usage of the new "repeat([n])" statement.
- cleanup of splitter behaviour in respect of high z inputs
- fixed an error that caused an exception if a circuit which directly connects an input to an output
  is used as embedded circuit.
- some minor bug fixes

v0.8, released on 20. Nov 2016
- added pull up & pull down resistors and programmable diodes
