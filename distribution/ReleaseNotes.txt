  uses wide shapes in the created circuits.

v0.25, released on 10. Aug. 2020
- Color schemes have been added to support color-blind users.

v0.14, released on 31. Aug 2017
- Added visualization of K-maps (thanks to roy77)
- Added VHDL export
  (Not yet complete, but the example processor is running on a FPGA.)
- Type of pin numbers changed from int to string to allow FPGA pin names like "U16".
- Added support for BASYS3-Board (*.xdc constraints file is written and the mixed mode
  clock manager (MMCM) is used if clock frequency exceeds 37kHz)
- Added shortcut 'B' which sets the number of data bits in all selected components.
- Breaking changes:
  - To generalize the VHDL export, an XML entity in the *.dig files had to be renamed.
    As a consequence of that the address bits settings in RAMs and ROMs
    are lost. To fix that, reset the number of address bits.
  - Added an enable input to the counter component. If you had used the counter in the
    past you have to set the en input to 1. The function of the overflow output also
    has changed (see tooltip) and now allows the cascading of counters.
  - XOR now can have more than two inputs. If you had used the XOR gate with inverted
    inputs, you have to reselect the inputs to invert.

  - If an error occurs, the name of the affected circuit file is shown.
  - If an error occurs, the causing sub circuit is highlighted.
  - A warning message shows up if a circuit with unnamed inputs is analysed.
  - A warning message shows up if a circuit with missing pin numbers is exported to a
    hardware-related file.

- Test results can be displayed as measurement graphs.
- The Text component is able to show multiple lines.
- Comments are allowed in hex files.
- Some minor bug fixes
- Breaking changes:
  - An input can have "high z" value as its default value.
    All inputs have lost their default values! If you have build a circuit that
    contains test cases that depend on a non-null default value, this tests
    will fail. To resolve this issue, reset the default value.
  - Added an enable input to the T flip-flop
    By default this input is activated now. In circuits which used the T flip-flop
    in the past, the new input needs to be disabled.
