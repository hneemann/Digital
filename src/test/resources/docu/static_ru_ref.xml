                Digital is a simple simulator used to simulate digital circuits. The logic gates are connected
                to each other by wires and the behavior of the overall circuit can be simulated.
                The user can interact with the simulation by either pressing buttons or setting
                values to the inputs of the circuit.
            </par>
            <par>
                In this way, most of the basic circuits used in digital electronics can be built and simulated.
                In the folder <e>examples</e>, users can browse for examples that includes a functional
                16-bit single-cycle Harvard processor.
            </par>
            <par>
                The simulator has two modes of operation: Editing and Simulation mode.
                In the editing mode, modifications to the circuit can be performed. Users can add or connect components.
                In this mode, simulation is disabled.
                The simulation mode is activated by pressing the <e>Start</e> button in the toolbar.
                While starting the simulation the circuit is checked for consistency.
                If there are errors in the circuit an appropriate message is shown and
                the affected components or wires are highlighted. If the circuit is error free, the simulation is
                enabled. Now you can interact with the running simulation.
                In the simulation mode it is not possible to modify the circuit. To do so you have to activate the
                editing mode again by stopping the simulation.

                As a first example, a circuit is to be constructed with an Exclusive-Or gate.
                From the main window, the <e>Components</e> menu allows you to select the various components.
                Then they are placed on the drawing panel. This process can be canceled by pressing the ESC key at any
                time. Start by selecting an input component.
                This can later be controlled interactively by using the mouse.
            <par><image src="scr01.png"/></par>
            <par>
                After selection, the first input can be placed on the drawing panel.
                The red dot on the input component symbol is a connection point between the component and a wire, which will be
                connected later on.
                The red color indicates an output. This means that the port defines a signal value or can drive a wire.
            </par>
            <par><image src="scr02.png"/></par>
            <par>
                In the same way, a second input is added. It is best to place it directly below the first input.
            </par><image src="scr03.png"/></par>
            <par>
                After adding the inputs, the Exclusive-Or gate is selected. This gate represents the actual logical
                function.
            </par>
            <par><image src="scr04.png"/></par>
            <par>
                This gate can now also be added to the circuit. It is best to place it in a way that the subsequent
                wiring is made as simple as possible. The blue dots indicate the input terminals of the gate.
            </par>
            <par><image src="scr05.png"/></par>
            <par>
                Now, select an output which could be used to display a signal state or to later pass signals to
                an embedding circuit.

            <par><image src="scr06.png"/></par>
            <par>
                This is placed in a way that it can be wired easily.
                The output has a blue dot, which indicates an input terminal.
                Here you can feed in the value which is then exported.
            </par>
            <par><image src="scr07.png"/></par>
            <par>
                After all components are selected and in place, use the mouse to wire a connection between the blue and
                red dots. Make sure that exactly one red dot is connected to any number of blue dots.
                Only the usage of three-state outputs makes it possible to deviate from this rule and to interconnect
                several red dots.
                If all wires have been drawn, the circuit is complete.

            <par>
                Interaction with the circuit is possible when simulation is started.
                This is done by clicking on the play button located in the toolbar.
                After starting the simulation, the color of the wires changes and the
                inputs and outputs are now filled. Bright green indicates a logical '1' and dark green a logical '0'.
                In the figure above, all wires have a '0' value.
            </par>
            <par><image src="scr09.png"/></par>
            <par>
                By clicking with the mouse, the inputs can be switched. Since the simulation is now active, the
                output changes according to the current input states. The circuit behaves like an
                Exclusive-Or gate as expected .

            <par><image src="scr10.png"/></par>
            <par>
                To further process the circuit, the simulation must first be stopped. The easiest way to do this is
                with the Stop button in the tool bar. Clicking on a component with the right mouse button
                (control-click on macOS) opens a dialog which shows the component's properties. The label 'A' can
                be defined for the first input via this dialog.
            </par>
            <par><image src="scr11.png"/></par>
            <par>
                In the same way, the labels for the remaining inputs and outputs can be defined. The menu item
                <e>Analysis</e> also contains a menu item <e>Analysis</e>. This function performs an analysis of
                the current circuit. However, this is only possible if all inputs and outputs are labeled properly.

                The truth table of the simulated circuit appears in a new window. Below the table you can find the
                algebraic expression associated with the circuit. If there are several possible algebraic
                expressions, a separate window will open, showing all possible expressions.

            <par>
                The table dialog has the menu entry <e>K-Map</e> in its main menu. This allows to display the truth
                table in the form of a K-map.
            </par>
            <par><image src="scr14.png"/></par>
            <par>
                At the top of this dialog there is a drop-down list which allows the selection of the desired
                expression in the K-map. In this way you can, for example, illustrate how several equivalent
                algebraic expressions can result. However, in this example, there is only one minimal expression.
                The truth table can also be modified by clicking the K-map.

                All components must be connected via wires. It is not possible to connect two components
                by placing them directly next to each other.
            </par>
            <par>
                In addition, there are only connections between an endpoint of a wire and a component.
                If a pin of a component is placed in the middle of a wire, no connection is made between the component
                and the wire.
                Therefore, a wire must actually terminate at each pin which is to be connected.
                Even if the tunnel component is used, there must be a wire between the pin and the tunnel element.
            </par>

                The component needs to be selected using the rectangular selection tool in order to be moved
                along with the connected wires. For moving a component without the connected wires,
                select the component using a mouse click.

                With CTRL-Click a single wire section can be selected to move or delete it.
                If the D key is pressed while drawing a wire, a diagonal wire can be drawn.
                The key S allows the splitting of a line segment into two segments.

                If a complex circuit is built up, this can quickly become very confusing. To keep track here,
                the different parts of a circuit can be stored in different files. This mechanism also makes it
                possible to use a subcircuit, which has been created once, several times in a further circuit.
                This approach also offers the advantage that the files can be stored independently of each other in a
                version control system and changes can be tracked.

                As an example, consider a 4-bit adder: First, we built a simple half-adder. This consists of an
                XOR gate and an AND gate. The sum of the two bits 'A' and 'B' is given to the outputs 'S' and 'C'.
                This circuit is stored in the file <e>halfAdder.dig</e>.

            <par><image src="scr21.png"/></par>
            <par>
                From two half adders a full adder can now be built. To do this, create a new empty file and save the
                empty file as <e>fullAdder.dig</e> in the same folder as the half adder. Then the
                half adder can be added to the new circuit via the <e>Components</e><arrow/><e>Custom</e> menu.
                The order of the pins at the package of the half-adder can be rearranged from the half adder in the
                menu <e>Edit</e><arrow/><e>Order inputs</e> or <e>Edit</e><arrow/><e>Order outputs</e>.
                The full adder adds the three bits 'A', 'B' and 'Ci' and gives the sum to the outputs 'S' and 'Co'.

            <par>
                In order to check the correct function of the full adder, a test case should be added. In the test case,
                the truth table is stored, which should fulfill the circuit. In this way it can be automatically
                checked whether this is the case.

                The tests can be executed via the test case editor or the test button in the toolbar.
                The table cells highlighted in green indicate that the output of the circuit matches
                the truth table given in the test case.

                Now the full adders can be put together to form a so-called ripple-carry adder.
                In this case, the carry output of an addition is forwarded as a carry input to the addition of the
                next higher-order bit, just as is usual in pencil-and-paper addition.
                This 4-bit adder should be tested for correct function. For this purpose a test case was inserted.

                This test case performs a 100% test, which is possible only with relatively simple circuits: all
                possible 512 input combinations are applied to the circuit, and it is checked whether the output
                of the circuit is correct.
                The first line lists the input and output signals. Below this, the input values to be applied and
                the output values to be checked are specified in a row, as in a truth table.
                In this example, however, 512 lines are required. Entering this would be a tedious and error-prone task.
                It is easier and more reliable to automatically generate the required lines.
                For this purpose, the variables <e>A</e> and <e>B</e> are each traversed
                from 0 to 15. The respective values of <e>A</e> and <e>B</e> are then assigned to inputs 'A[n]' and 'B[n]'.
                Then it is checked whether the circuit outputs the value <e>A+B</e>. Then it is checked again with
                the carry bit set, in which case <e>A+B+1</e> must result.
                The details of the test syntax are provided by the help dialog.

                If a circuit is embedded in an other circuit, only the file name of the subcircuit is stored in a
                circuit, not the embedded circuit itself.
                The corresponding files of
                the embedded subcircuits must therefore be found in the file system at runtime of the simulation.
                In order to support the various work methods of the users as best as possible and still to avoid a
                complex administration of import paths, etc., a somewhat unusual import strategy is implemented.
            </par>
            <par>
                Only the file names of the embedded circuits are stored in a circuits file, not the full path.
                If a file needs to be opened, all subfolders are searched for a file of the corresponding name.
                If a suitable file is found, it is imported. This process only depends on the file name of the file to
                be read, not on its path. Correspondingly, an error message is generated if there are several files of
                the same name in different subfolders, since ambiguities then arise.
            </par>
            <par>
                A suitable project structure therefore looks as follows: The root circuit is located in a separate
                folder.
                All imported circuits must be in the same folder or subfolders. All circuits must have different names,
                so it must not happen that there are circuits of the same name in different folders.

        <subchapter heading="Propagation Delay">
            <par>
                During the simulation every logic gate has a propagation delay. Every component found in the library
                has the same propagation delay regardless of its complexity.
                The AND gate thus has the same propagation delay as the multiplier.
                The only exceptions are diodes, switches and splitters which are used to create data buses.
                These components have no propagation delay at all.
            </par>
            <par>
                If it's necessary to simulate a gate - e.g. the multiplier - with a longer propagation delay, a delay
                gate must be inserted in the circuit right behind the output of the multiplier.
            </par>
            <par>
                If a circuit is included in another parent circuit, the included circuit keeps its timing behaviour.
                So if you include a complex circuit which has a large propagation delay because the input signals
                has to pass three gates until it reaches the output, this behaviour is conserved while including this
                circuit.
                There are no additional delays introduced as a result of including a circuit. If not all outputs of a
                circuit have
                the same propagation delay, then this is also the case if it is included in a parent circuit.
                In general, including a circuit into an other circuit does not modify its timing behaviour at all. An
                included circuit behaves exactly the same way as if all components had been inserted at the same circuit
                level.

                A circuit can be analyzed via the menu entry <e>Analysis</e>. A truth table is generated for purely
                combinatorial circuits. This truth table can be edited as desired.

                In addition to purely combinatorial circuits, it is also possible to analyze or generate sequential
                circuits.
                Instead of a simple truth table a so-called state transition table is created.
                Each flip-flop thereby appears on the input side and the output side of the state transition table.
            In this table, on the right-hand side, you can find the next state, which will
            occur after the next clock signal. This next state depends on the current state of the flip-flops as found
            at the left-hand side of the table.
            For an analysis to be possible, the flip-flops must be named.

            The following naming convention applies: The following next state of a bit on the right side of the table
            is indicated by a lowercase 'n+1'. The corresponding current state is indicated by an appended 'n'.
            If there is a state variable 'A', 'An' indicates the current state and 'An+1' indicates the next state.
            If, in the truth table on the left and right side, signals are present, which correspond to this pattern
            it is assumed that the table is a state transition table, and a sequential circuit is generated instead of
            a combinatorial circuit.

                It should be noted that the circuit to be analyzed may contain only purely combinatorial elements in
                addition to the built-in D and JK flip-flops. If a flip-flop is e.g. made from Nor gates, this
                circuit is not recognized as a flip-flop and therefore it is not possible to analyse such a circuit.

                Thereby different outputs can be set in the different states.

                For a BASYS3 board, if the circuit clock frequency is low, a frequency divider is integrated into the HDL

                If the clock frequency selected in the circuit exceeds 4.7MHz, the MMCM unit of the

    <chapter heading="Custom Shapes">
        <par>
            Although Digital has some options that determine the appearance of a circuit when it is embedded in
            another, in some cases it may be useful to use a very special shape for a subcircuit. An example is
            the representation of the ALU in the processor included in the examples. This chapter explains how to
            define such a special shape for a circuit.
        </par>
        <par>
            Digital does not provide an editor for creating a special shape. Instead, a small detour is required
            for creating circuit shapes: First, the circuit which is to be represented by a special shape is opened.
            Then an SVG template is created for this circuit. In this template, the circuit is represented by a
            simple rectangle. It also contains all the pins of the circuit, represented by blue (inputs) and
            red (outputs) circles. To see which circle belongs to which pin, you can look at the ID of the
            circle in the object properties. This ID has the form <e>pin:[name]</e> or <e>pin+:[name]</e>.
            In the latter variant, the pin is provided with a label if reimported to digital.
            If you do not want such a label, the <e>+</e> can be removed.
        </par>
        <par>
            This SVG file can now be edited. The most suitable is the open source program
            <a href="https://inkscape.org/en/">Inkscape</a> which is available for free.
            The pins can be moved freely, but are moved to the next grid point during the reimport.
        </par>
        <par>
            If existing SVG files are to be used, it is easiest to open the created template and paste the
            existing graphic into the template via Copy&amp;Paste.
        </par>
        <par>
            If the file was saved, it can be imported with Digital. The file is read in and all necessary
            information is extracted and stored in the circuit. For further use of the circuit, the SVG
            file is no longer required.
        </par>
        <par>
            A final remark: SVG is a very powerful and flexible file format.
            It can be used to describe extremely complex graphics. The Digital importer is not able to import all
            possible SVG files without errors. If a file can not be imported, or does not appear as expected,
            some experimentation may be required before the desired result is achieved.

    <chapter heading="Generic Circuits">
        <par>
            It happens that a subcircuit has been created, and is to be used in different variants.
            For example, you can imagine a special counter that is needed for different bit widths.
            If one would create a subcircuit for 4, 5 and 6 bits each, the maintenance of the circuit
            would be difficult in the future, since one must always work on several subcircuits, which are
            identical except for one parameter, the bit width.
        </par>
        <par>
            To prevent this, a generic subcircuit which can be parameterized can be created.
            For this purpose, the checkbox "Circuit is generic" must be set in the circuit specific settings.
            Then the parameter dialog of each component in that circuit contains the additional field "generic
            parameterization". In this field program code can be entered, which can change the parameters of the
            component. Each parameter has a name and can be modified as an attribute of the field <e>this</e>.
            The names of the parameters can be found in the help dialog of the component.
            If you want to change the bit width of an adder, the line <e>this.Bits=1;</e> can be used.
        </par>
        <par>
            In this way, however, it is not yet possible to create a circuit that can be parameterized.
            It is still necessary to access parameters that are set when the circuit is used.
            This is done via the field "args". If you want to set the bit width from outside, you can write:
            <e>this.Bits=args.bitWidth;</e>. The name of the argument - here <e>bitWidth</e> is arbitrary.
            If such a subcircuit is used, this argument must be set.
        </par>
        <par>
            If the circuit is used and the parameter dialog of the embedded circuit is opened, it also has a
            field "generic parameterization". Here the bit width to be used can be set with the instruction
            <e>bitWidth:=5;</e>.
        </par>
        <par>
            If a generic circuit is to be started directly, this is not possible straight away, since the required
            arguments are missing, which have to be specified when embedding the circuit. These missing arguments
            would lead to corresponding error messages.
            Therefore, to simplify the testing of the circuit, the <e>Generic Initialization</e> component can be
            added to the circuit. In this component you can set the arguments that would come from an embedding circuit.
            In this way, a generic circuit can also be simulated directly.
            If the circuit is embedded, this component is ignored.
            It is only needed for the direct start of the simulation.
        </par>
        <par>
            Under certain circumstances it may be useful not only to change the attributes of the components of a
            circuit, but to add completely new components and wires depending on the passed arguments.
            The <e>Code</e> component can be used for this purpose. If it is added to the circuit, the contained
            Code will be executed when the simulation is started.
            Here, a wire can be added using the <e>addWire([x1],[y1],[x2],[y2])</e> function, and using the function
            <e>addComponent([name],[x],[y])</e> a new component <e>[name]</e> can be added at the position ([x],[y]).
            The return value of the <e>addComponent([Name],[x],[y])</e> function allows to set the parameters of the
            component.
        </par>
        <par>
            The example circuit <e>examples/generic/modify/Conway/GenericConway.dig</e> shows how a more complex
            circuit can be assembled in this way.
        </par>
        <par>
            Another way to create a circuit is recursion: it is possible, depending on the arguments, to replace one
            circuit by another. For this purpose the function <e>setCircuit([Name])</e> is available.
            If it is called in the definition part of a subcircuit, the circuit to be inserted can be replaced
            by another circuit. This allows the recursive definition of a circuit. As in other programming
            languages, a suitable termination condition must be ensured.

        <par>
            The <e>examples/generic</e> folder contains an example of a Gray code counter whose bit width can
            be configured. Here a Gray code counter is constructed by recursively adding further bits to an
            initial circuit until the required number of bits of the counter is reached.
