                Digital is a simple simulator used to simulate digital circuits. The single logic gates are connected
                to each other by wires and the behaviour of the whole circuit is simulated.
                The user is able to interact with the circuit while it is running by pressing buttons or setting values
                to the inputs of the circuit.
            </par>
            <par>
                In this way you can build and simulate most of the fundamental circuits used in digital electronics.
                In the folder <e>examples</e> you can find many examples including a working 16 bit single cycle harvard
                processor.

            <par>
                The simulator has two modes of operation: In the editing mode it is possible to modify the circuit.
                You can add components or connect components by wires. The simulation is not active in this mode.
                The simulation mode is activated by pressing <e>Start</e>. While starting the simulation the circuit
                is checked for consistency. If the are errors in the circuit an error message is shown. If possible
                the affected components or wires are highlighted. If there are no errors, the simulation is activated.
                Now you can interact with the running simulation.
                In the simulation mode it is not possible to modify the circuit. To do so you have to activate the
                editing mode again by stopping the simulation.

                All components must be connected via wires. It is not possible to connect two components
                by placing them directly next to each other.
            </par>
            <par>
                In addition, there are only connections between a endpoint of a wire and a component.
                If a pin of a component is placed in the middle of a wire, no connection is made between the component
                and the wire.
                Therefore, a wire must actually terminate at each pin which is to be connected to another.
                Even if the tunnel component is used, there must be a wire between the pin and the tunnel element.
            </par>
            <par>
                If a component is to be moved including the connected wires, the component needs to be selected
                with the rectangular selection. The rectangular selection must contain the whole component.
                Then it can be moved with the mouse. If an element is selected by a mouse click, only the component
                itself can be moved - without the connected wires.

                If a very complex circuit is built up, this can very quickly become very confusing. To keep track here,
                the different parts of a circuit can be stored in different files. This mechanism also makes it
                possible to use a subcircuit, which has been created once, several times in a further circuit.
                This approach also offers the advantage that the files can be stored independently of each other in a
                version control system and changes can be tracked.
            </par>
            <par>
                In this case, only the file names of the subcircuits are stored in a circuit. The corresponding files of
                the integrated subcircuits must therefore be found at the runtime of the simulation in the file system.
                In order to support the various work methods of the users as best as possible and still to avoid a
                complex administration of import paths, etc., a somewhat unusual import strategy is implemented.
            </par>
            <par>
                Only the file names of the embedded circuits are stored in a circuits file.
                If a file needs to be opened, all subfolders are searched for a file of the corresponding name.
                If a suitable file is found, it is imported. This process only depends on the file name of the file to
                be read, not on its path. Correspondingly, an error message is generated if there are several files of
                the same name in different subfolders, since ambiguities then arise.
            </par>
            <par>
                A suitable project structure therefore looks as follows: The root circuit is located in a separate
                folder.
                All imported circuits must be in the same folder or subfolders. All circuits must have different names,
                so it must not happen that there are circuits of the same name in different folders.

        <subchapter name="Propagation Delay">
            <par>
                During the simulation every logic gate has a propagation delay. Every component from the library
                has the same propagation delay regardless of its complexity.
                So a NOT gate has the same propagation delay as a RAM component or a flipflop.
                The only exceptions are diodes, switches and splitters which are used to create data buses.
                These components have no propagation delay at all.
            </par>
            <par>
                If a circuit is included in an other parent circuit, the included circuit keep its timing behaviour.
                So if you include a complex circuit which has a large propagation delay because on of the input signals
                has to pass three gates until it reaches the output, this behaviour is conserved while including this
                circuit.
                There are no additional delays coming up by including a circuit. If not all outputs of a circuit have
                the same propagation delay this is also the case if it is included in a parent circuit.
                In general, including a circuit into an other circuit does not modify its timing behaviour at all. A
                included circuit behave in exact the same way as if all components had been inserted at the same circuit
                level.

            A circuit can be analyzed via the menu entry <e>Analysis</e>. A truth table is generated for purely
            combinatorial circuits. This truth table can be edited as desired.
            A new circuit can be generated from this truth table after editing.
        </par>
        <par>
            In addition to purely combinatorial circuits, it is also possible to analyze or generate sequential
            circuits.
            Instead of a simple truth table a so-called state transition table is created.
            Each flip-flop thereby appears on the input side and the output side of the state transition table.
            In this table, on the right-hand side, you can find the next state, which will
            occur after the next clock signal. This next state depends on the current state of the flip-flops as found
            at the left-hand side of the table.
            For an analysis to be possible, the flipflops must be named.
        </par>
        <par>
            The following naming convention applies: The following next state of a bit on the right side of the table
            is indicated by a descended small 'n+1'. The corresponding current state is indicated by an appended 'n'.
            If there is a state variable 'A', 'An' indicates the current state and 'An+1' indicates the next state.
            If, in the truth table on the left and right side, signals are present, which correspond to this pattern
            it is assumed that the table is a state transition table, and a sequential circuit is generated instead of
            a combinatorial circuit.
        </par>
        <par>
            It should be noted that the circuit to be analyzed may contain only purely combinatorial elements in
            addition to the built-in D and JK flipflops. If a flip-flop is e.g. made from Nor gates, this
            circuit is not recognized as a flip-flop and therefore not treated accordingly. In this case, the
            circuit is not analyzed correctly, which means that an incorrect state transition table is generated.

                In the menu of the circuit generation in the truth table there are also functions to generate so-called
                JEDEC files. This is a special file format that describes the fuse map of a PLD.
                This JEDEC file can be written into a corresponding PLD using a special programmer.
