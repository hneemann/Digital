                Digital is a simulator for digital circuits. A circuit consists of one or more number of logic gates connected 
                to each other using lines whereas the behavior of the overall circuit can be simulated. The user can interact with 
                the simulation by either pressing a Buttons or setting input values.
            </par>
            <par>
                In this way, most of the basic circuits used in digital electronics can be built and simulated. In the folder
                <e> examples </e>, users can browse for examples that includes a functional 16-bit single-cycle Harvard processor.
            </par>
            <par>
                The simulator has two modes of operation: Editing and Simulation mode. 
                
                In the editing mode, modification of circuit can be performed in this mode. Users can add or connect components. 
                In this mode, simulation is disabled.
                
                To enable simulation mode, users should press the <e>Start</e> button in the tool bar. Before the simulation is enabled, 
                simulated circuit is checked with errors. An error message apppears stating that the simulated circuit has errors. 
                If simulated circuit is free from errors, users can now interact with the running simulation. To continue editing 
                the circuit, users must first stop the simulation.

                As a first example, a circuit is to be constructed with an exclusive OR gate.
                From the main window, the <e> Components </e> menu allows you to select the various components. This components,
                if enabled or selected, it can be placed in the drawing panel. This process can be cancelled by pressing 
                ESC key at any time.
                
                Start by selecting input to be added to the circuit. Input values can be change interactively 
                by using a mouse later on.
            <par><image src="scr01.png"/></par>
            <par>
                After selection, the first input can be placed on the drawing surface. The red dot marks the wire
                connection. Here, a wire will be connected later. Red indicates that this port is active.
                So he defines a signal value.
            </par>
            <par><image src="scr02.png"/></par>
            <par>
                In the same way, a second input is added. It is best to put it directly under the first input.
            </par><image src="scr03.png"/></par>
            <par>
                Thereafter, the Exclusive-Or gate is selected. This gate represents the actual logical function.
            </par>
            <par><image src="scr04.png"/></par>
            <par>
                This gate can now also be inserted in the circuit. It is best to set it in a way that the subsequent
                wiring is as simple as possible. The blue dots indicate the inputs of the gate.
            </par>
            <par><image src="scr05.png"/></par>
            <par>
                Now select an output. This can be used to indicate a signal state or to later pass signals to
                an embedding circuit.
            </par>
            <par><image src="scr06.png"/></par>
            <par>
                This is also positioned so that the wiring become as simple as possible.
                He has a blue dot, so has an input.

            <par><image src="scr07.png"/></par>
            <par>
                Now all necessary components are present. At next the wiring has to be added. With the mouse
                a wire can be drawn. The blue and red dots are to be connected. There must always be exactly
                one red dot connected to any number of blue dots. Only the use of threestate outputs makes it
                possible to deviate from this rule and to connect several red dots.
                If all wires have been drawn, the circuit is complete.

            <par>
                To be able to interact with the circuit, it must be started. The start button in the tool bar can
                be used for this purpose. After starting the simulation, the color of the wires changes and the
                inputs and outputs are now filled. A bright green marks a logical '1' and a dark green a logical '0'.
                In the figure above, all wires have a '0' value.
            </par>
            <par><image src="scr09.png"/></par>
            <par>
                By clicking with the mouse, the inputs can be switched. Since the simulation is now active, the
                output changes according to the current input states. The circuit behaves like an
                Exclusive-Or gate as expected .

            <par><image src="scr10.png"/></par>
            <par>
                To further process the circuit, the simulation must first be stopped. The easiest way to do this is
                with the Stop button in the tool bar. Clicking on a component with the right mouse button opens a
                dialog which displays the properties of this component. The label 'A' can be defined for the first
                input via this dialog.
            </par>
            <par><image src="scr11.png"/></par>
            <par>
                In this way, the labels for the remaining inputs and outputs can be defined. The menu item
                <e>Analysis</e> also contains a menu item <e>Analysis</e>. This function performs an analysis of
                the current circuit. However, this is only possible if all inputs and outputs are labeled.

                It opens a window showing the truth table of the current circuit. Below the table you can find the
                algebraic expression associated with the circuit. If there are several possible algebraic
                expressions, a separate window will open showing all possible expressions.

            <par><image src="scr13.png"/></par>
            <par>
                The table dialog has the menu entry <e>K-Map</e> in its main menu. This allows to display the truth
                table in the form of a K-map.

            <par>
                At the top of this dialog there is a drop-down list which allows the selection of the desired
                expression in the K-map. In this way you can, for example, illustrate how several equivalent
                algebraic expressions can result. However, in this example, there is only one minimal expression.
                By clicking in the K-map the table can be modified.

                All components must be connected via wires. It is not possible to connect two components
                by placing them directly next to each other.
            </par>
            <par>
                In addition, there are only connections between a endpoint of a wire and a component.
                If a pin of a component is placed in the middle of a wire, no connection is made between the component
                and the wire.
                Therefore, a wire must actually terminate at each pin which is to be connected to another.
                Even if the tunnel component is used, there must be a wire between the pin and the tunnel element.
            </par>
            <par>
                If a component is to be moved including the connected wires, the component needs to be selected
                with the rectangular selection. The rectangular selection must contain the whole component.
                Then it can be moved with the mouse. If an element is selected by a mouse click, only the component
                itself can be moved - without the connected wires.

                If a complex circuit is built up, this can quickly become very confusing. To keep track here,
                the different parts of a circuit can be stored in different files. This mechanism also makes it
                possible to use a subcircuit, which has been created once, several times in a further circuit.
                This approach also offers the advantage that the files can be stored independently of each other in a
                version control system and changes can be tracked.

                As an example, consider a 4-bit adder: First, we built a simple half-adder. This consists of an
                XOR gate and an AND gate. The sum of the two bits 'A' and 'B' is given to the outputs 'S' and 'C'.
                This circuit is stored in the file <e>halfAdder.dig</e>.
            </par>
            <par><image src="scr21.png"/></par>
            <par>
                From two half adders a full adder can now be built. To do this, create a new empty file and save the
                empty file as <e>fullAdder.dig</e> in the same folder as before the half adder. Then the
                half adder can be added to the new circuit via the <e>Components</e><arrow/><e>Custom</e> menu.
                The order of the pins at the package of the half-adder can be rearranged in the half adder in the
                menu <e>Edit</e><arrow/><e>Order inputs</e> or <e>Edit</e><arrow/><e>Order outputs</e>.
                The full adder adds the three bits 'A', 'B' and 'Ci' and gives the sum to the outputs 'S' and 'Co'.

            <par><image src="scr22.png"/></par>
            <par>
                In order to check the correct function of the full adder, a test case should be added. In the test case,
                the truth table is stored, which should fulfill the circuit. In this way it can be automatically
                checked whether this is the case.
            </par>
            <par><image src="scr23.png"/></par>
            <par>
                The tests can be executed via the test case editor or the test button in the toolbar.
                The table cells highlighted in green indicate that the output of the circuit matches
                the truth table given in the test case.

                Now the full adders can be put together to form a so-called ripple-carry adder.
                In this case, the carry output of an addition is forwarded as a carry input to the addition of the
                next higher-order bit, just as it is usual in pencil-and-paper addition.
                This 4-bit adder should be tested for correct function. For this purpose a test case was inserted.

                This test case performs a 100% test, which is possible only with relatively simple circuits: all
                possible 512 input combinations are applied to the circuit, and it is checked whether the output
                of the circuit is correct.
                The first line lists the input and output signals. Below this, the input values to be applied and
                the output values to be checked are specified in a row, as in a truth table.
                In this example, however, 512 lines are required. Entering this would be a tedious and error-prone task.
                It is easier and more reliable to automatically generate the required lines.
                For this purpose, the variables <e>A</e> and <e>B</e> are each traversed
                from 0 to 15. The respective values of <e>A</e> and <e>B </e> are then assigned to inputs 'A[n]' and 'B[n]'.
                Then it is checked whether the circuit outputs the value <e>A+B</e>. Then it is checked again with
                the carry bit set, in which case <e>A+B+1</e> must result.
                The details of the test syntax are provided by the help dialog.

            <par>
                If a circuit is embedded in an other ciruit, only the file name of the subcircuit is stored in a
                circuit, not the embedded circuit itself.
                The corresponding files of
                the embedded subcircuits must therefore be found in the file system at runtime of the simulation.
                In order to support the various work methods of the users as best as possible and still to avoid a
                complex administration of import paths, etc., a somewhat unusual import strategy is implemented.
            </par>
            <par>
                Only the file names of the embedded circuits are stored in a circuits file, not the full path.
                If a file needs to be opened, all subfolders are searched for a file of the corresponding name.
                If a suitable file is found, it is imported. This process only depends on the file name of the file to
                be read, not on its path. Correspondingly, an error message is generated if there are several files of
                the same name in different subfolders, since ambiguities then arise.
            </par>
            <par>
                A suitable project structure therefore looks as follows: The root circuit is located in a separate
                folder.
                All imported circuits must be in the same folder or subfolders. All circuits must have different names,
                so it must not happen that there are circuits of the same name in different folders.

        <subchapter name="Propagation Delay">
            <par>
                During the simulation every logic gate has a propagation delay. Every component found in the library
                has the same propagation delay regardless of its complexity.
                The AND gate thus has the same propagation delay as the multiplier.
                The only exceptions are diodes, switches and splitters which are used to create data buses.
                These components have no propagation delay at all.
            </par>
            <par>
                If it's necessary to simulate a gate - e.g. the multiplier - with a longer propagation delay, a delay
                gate must be inserted in the circuit right behind the output of the multiplier.
            </par>
            <par>
                If a circuit is included in an other parent circuit, the included circuit keeps its timing behaviour.
                So if you include a complex circuit which has a large propagation delay because the input signals
                has to pass three gates until it reaches the output, this behaviour is conserved while including this
                circuit.
                There are no additional delays coming up by including a circuit. If not all outputs of a circuit have
                the same propagation delay this is also the case if it is included in a parent circuit.
                In general, including a circuit into an other circuit does not modify its timing behaviour at all. A
                included circuit behave in exact the same way as if all components had been inserted at the same circuit
                level.

            A circuit can be analyzed via the menu entry <e>Analysis</e>. A truth table is generated for purely
            combinatorial circuits. This truth table can be edited as desired.
            A new circuit can be generated from this truth table after editing.

        <par>
            In addition to purely combinatorial circuits, it is also possible to analyze or generate sequential
            circuits.
            Instead of a simple truth table a so-called state transition table is created.
            Each flip-flop thereby appears on the input side and the output side of the state transition table.
            In this table, on the right-hand side, you can find the next state, which will
            occur after the next clock signal. This next state depends on the current state of the flip-flops as found
            at the left-hand side of the table.
            For an analysis to be possible, the flipflops must be named.
        </par>
        <par>
            The following naming convention applies: The following next state of a bit on the right side of the table
            is indicated by a descended small 'n+1'. The corresponding current state is indicated by an appended 'n'.
            If there is a state variable 'A', 'An' indicates the current state and 'An+1' indicates the next state.
            If, in the truth table on the left and right side, signals are present, which correspond to this pattern
            it is assumed that the table is a state transition table, and a sequential circuit is generated instead of
            a combinatorial circuit.
        </par>
        <par>
            It should be noted that the circuit to be analyzed may contain only purely combinatorial elements in
            addition to the built-in D and JK flipflops. If a flip-flop is e.g. made from Nor gates, this
            circuit is not recognized as a flip-flop and therefore it is not possible to analyse such a circuit.

                Unfortunately, the fuse map details are not public available so that no suitable fitter for this chip
                can be integrated in Digital, as it is possible with the <e>GAL16v8</e> and <e>GAL22v10</e> chips.

                Therefore, the fitters <e>fit150[x].exe</e> provided by ATMEL must be used. These programs create a
                <e>JEDEC</e> file from a suitable <e>TT2</e> file which can then be programmed to the chip. Digital
                starts the fitter automatically every time a <e>TT2</e> file is created. For this purpose, the path to the
                <e>fit150[n].exe</e> fitters must be specified in the settings.
                The created <e>JEDEC</e> file can then be opened and programmed directly with

                A circuit can be exported to VHDL. A file is generated which contains the complete description of the
                circuit. The generated VHDL code was tested with

                If the circuit clock frequency is low, a frequency divider is integrated into the VHDL code to divide
                the board clock accordingly.
                If the clock frequency selected in the circuit exceeds 37kHz, the MMCM unit of the
                Artix-7 is used for clock generation.
                This ensures that the FPGA resources provided for the clock distribution are used.
                This allows the included example processor to run at 20MHz and if you can do without the
                multiplier also 30HMz is possible.

                If a circuit is to run on a BASYS3 board, a new project can be created in Vivado.
                The generated VHDL file and the constraints file must be added to the project.
                Once the project has been created, the bitstream can be generated and the Hardware-Manager can be used
                to program a BASYS3 board.
