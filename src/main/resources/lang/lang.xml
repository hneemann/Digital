To add a new language, you can add the language to this file.
Use the language name in this language.
Then copy one of the available language files, rename it and
translate it into the new language.

If you also want to translate the static part of the documentation,
you must translate one of the files "static_xx.xml" from the folder
"src/test/resources/docu".

If you are happy with the translation, you can send a pull request.
Or you open a new GitHub issue and add the files to this issue.
