To add a new language, you can add the language to this file.
Use the name of the language in that language.
Then run the test case "de.neemann.digital.lang.TestLang.testAdditionalLanguages".

In the target directory you can now find a diff file for the
new language. This diff file contains a list of English text
fragments and a empty xml tag for the translated text fragment.
Fill all the empty language tags.

To import the translated text, start the class
"de.neemann.digital.lang.LanguageUpdater" and select
your diff file.

In the future, each time the software is built, a new
diff file will be created that contains all the new or
modified keys.
