        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        When a circuit containing a ROM component is embedded multiple times, the contents of the ROM
        is normally used for each instance of that circuit. Under certain circumstances,
        however, it may be desirable for such a circuit to be embedded multiple times,
        but different ROM contents are used for each instance.<br/>
        This problem occurs e.g. if a 74xx ROM is used multiple times but with different
        memory contents.<br/>
        <h3>Function</h3>
        At this location, therefore, contents can be defined for all ROM's in the circuit.
        When the simulation model is generated, every ROM is initialized with the contents stored
        directly in the respective ROM. Then it is checked whether an alternative content is
        defined here. If this is the case, the content defined here is loaded into the corresponding ROM.
        <h3>Usage</h3>
        It should be noted that each ROM requires a unique name used to identify the ROM.
        To do this, use the asterisk ('*') in the label of the ROM. The asterisk is then replaced by the complete
        path constructed from the names of the embedded circuits.
        If a circuit contains only one ROM component, it is sufficient to use only the asterisk as a label for it.
        All embedded circuits must be named so that a unique name can be formed for each ROM component.

    <string name="msg_expressionHelpTitle">Expressions</string>
    <string name="msg_expressionHelp">To define an expression you can use all most common notations:

        And: &quot;&amp;&quot;, &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;∧&quot;
        Or: &quot;|&quot;, &quot;||&quot;, &quot;+&quot;, &quot;∨&quot;, &quot;#&quot;
        XOr: &quot;^&quot;, &quot;⊻&quot;
        Not: &quot;!&quot;, &quot;~&quot;, &quot;&#172;&quot;

        As usual AND precedes OR and XOr.

        Multiple expressions can be separated by "," or ";".
        If you want to name the expressions you can use the
        let-command: "let U=A+B, let V=A*B"</string>
    <string name="msg_testVectorHelpTitle">Test vectors</string>
    <string name="msg_testVectorHelp"><![CDATA[<html>
    <head><style>pre { background-color: #E0E0E0;}</style></head>
    <body>
<p>The first line has to contain the names of inputs and outputs.
The following lines contain the expected values.
A 'X' represents a don't care, and a 'Z' represents a high Z value.
If a 'C' is used, at first all other values are set, after that a clock cycle is performed and than the
values are compared. So it's easier to test sequential logic.
A line which starts with a number sign ('#') is a comment.</p>

<p>So a test for a 2-bit counter could look like this:</p>

<pre>
C Q1 Q0
0 0  0
C 0  1
C 1  0
C 1  1
C 0  0
</pre>

<p>The tests are executed by Run->Run Tests.</p>
<p>
To make it easier to create a lot of test vectors there is the 'repeat([n])' statement:
If a line begins with 'repeat([n])', [n] test lines are generated. The
Variable 'n' can be used to generate the test data. With 'repeat(16)'
16 lines are created, where n goes from 0 to 15. If there are multiple bit inputs,
and these are to be set together to a binary value, this can be done with the
'bits([bits], [value])' statement. This is used to create [bits] bits of the value [value].</p>

<p>The following is an example that tests a 4-bit adder:</p>

<pre>
           C_i-1  A_3 A_2 A_1 A_0  B_3 B_2 B_1 B_0  C_i S_3 S_2 S_1 S_0
repeat(256)  0    bits(4,n>>4)     bits(4,n)        bits(5,(n>>4)+(n&15))
repeat(256)  1    bits(4,n>>4)     bits(4,n)        bits(5,(n>>4)+(n&15)+1)
</pre>

<p>The input signals are the carry-in (C_i-1) and the eight input bits A_3-A_0 and B_3-B_0.
The 4 input bits are generated with the 'bits' instruction. The result (C_i, S_3-S_0) is also generated
by a 'bits' instruction.
This happens once with C_i-1 = 0 and in the next line with C_i-1 = 1.
In this way, 512 test rows are generated which cover all possible input configurations.</p>
<p>If multiple rows are to be repeated, or if nested loops are required, the loop
statement can be used. The above example could also be implemented as follows:</p>

<pre>
           C_i-1  A_3 A_2 A_1 A_0  B_3 B_2 B_1 B_0  C_i S_3 S_2 S_1 S_0
loop(a,16)
  loop(b,16)
             0    bits(4,a)        bits(4,b)        bits(5,a+b)
             1    bits(4,a)        bits(4,b)        bits(5,a+b+1)
  end loop
end loop
</pre>

<p>It may be helpful to generate random numbers in test cases.
These can be created with the function 'random([n])'. The generated number is greater
than or equal to zero and less than [n]. Considering a 16-bit multiplier as an example,
a full test can not be performed since it would have 2^32 input combinations.
A regression test that multiplies 100000 random numbers might look like this:</p>

<pre>
   A    B      Y
loop(i,100000)
  let a = random(1&lt;&lt;16);
  let b = random(1&lt;&lt;16);
  (a)  (b)   (a*b)
end loop
</pre>

<p>An input that allows high impedance as a value can also be used as a test output.
In this case, the signal name can be used with a trailing "_out" to read back and check the current value.
For this, the corresponding input must be set to high impedance ('Z').</p>

<pre>OE CLK D D_out
0   0  0 0
0   C  1 1
1   0  z 1
0   C  0 0
1   0  z 0
</pre>

<p>The circuit for this test has only one input 'D', but which can be high impedance state.
Therefore, the signal 'D_out' is also available to check the value in this case.</p>
