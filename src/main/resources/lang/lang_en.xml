        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        When a circuit containing a ROM component is embedded multiple times, the contents of the ROM
        is normally used for each instance of that circuit. Under certain circumstances,
        however, it may be desirable for such a circuit to be embedded multiple times,
        but different ROM contents are used for each instance.<br/>
        This problem occurs e.g. if a 74xx ROM is used multiple times but with different
        memory contents.<br/>
        <h3>Function</h3>
        At this location, therefore, contents can be defined for all ROMs in the circuit.
        When the simulation model is generated, every ROM is initialized with the contents stored
        directly in the respective ROM. Then it is checked whether an alternative content is
        defined here. If this is the case, the content defined here is loaded into the corresponding ROM.
        <h3>Usage</h3>
        It should be noted that each ROM requires a unique name used to identify the ROM.
        To do this, use the asterisk ('*') in the label of the ROM. The asterisk is then replaced by the complete
        path constructed from the names of the embedded circuits.
        If a circuit contains only one ROM component, it is sufficient to use only the asterisk as a label for it.
        All embedded circuits must be named so that a unique name can be formed for each ROM component.

    <string name="msg_testVectorHelp"><![CDATA[<html>
    <head><style>pre { background-color: #E0E0E0;}</style></head>
    <body>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>The first line has to contain the names of inputs and outputs.
The following lines contain the expected values.
A 'X' represents a don't care, and a 'Z' represents a high Z value.
If a 'C' is used, at first all other values are set, after that a clock cycle is performed and then the
values are compared. So it's easier to test sequential logic.
A line which starts with a number sign ('#') is a comment.</p>

<p>So a test for a 2-bit counter could look like this:</p>

<pre>
C Q1 Q0
0 0  0
C 0  1
C 1  0
C 1  1
C 0  0
</pre>

<p>The tests are executed by Run->Run Tests.</p>
<p>
To make it easier to create a lot of test vectors there is the 'repeat([n])' statement:
If a line begins with 'repeat([n])', [n] test lines are generated. The
variable 'n' can be used to generate the test data. With 'repeat(16)',
16 lines are created, where n goes from 0 to 15. If there are multiple bit inputs,
and these are to be set together to a binary value, this can be done with the
'bits([bits], [value])' statement. This is used to create [bits] bits of the value [value].</p>

<p>The following is an example that tests a 4-bit adder:</p>

<pre>
           C_i-1  A_3 A_2 A_1 A_0  B_3 B_2 B_1 B_0  C_i S_3 S_2 S_1 S_0
repeat(256)  0    bits(4,n>>4)     bits(4,n)        bits(5,(n>>4)+(n&15))
repeat(256)  1    bits(4,n>>4)     bits(4,n)        bits(5,(n>>4)+(n&15)+1)
</pre>

<p>The input signals are the carry-in (C_i-1) and the eight input bits A_3-A_0 and B_3-B_0.
The 4 input bits are generated with the 'bits' instruction. The result (C_i, S_3-S_0) is also generated
by a 'bits' instruction.
This happens once with C_i-1 = 0 and in the next line with C_i-1 = 1.
In this way, 512 test rows are generated which cover all possible input configurations.</p>
<p>If multiple rows are to be repeated, or if nested loops are required, the loop
statement can be used. The above example could also be implemented as follows:</p>

<pre>
           C_i-1  A_3 A_2 A_1 A_0  B_3 B_2 B_1 B_0  C_i S_3 S_2 S_1 S_0
loop(a,16)
  loop(b,16)
             0    bits(4,a)        bits(4,b)        bits(5,a+b)
             1    bits(4,a)        bits(4,b)        bits(5,a+b+1)
  end loop
end loop
</pre>

<p>Under certain circumstances it may be necessary to be able to react to the initial
state of the circuit. Therefore the signals provided in the circuit can be used within
the test case. For example, if a counter that starts in an undefined state is to be
tested, it can be clocked to a defined state:</p>

<pre>C Q_3 Q_2 Q_1 Q_0

# clock counter to 1111
while(!(Q_3 & Q_2 & Q_1 & Q_0))
C x x x x
end while

# start the test execution
repeat(16) C bits(4,n)
</pre>

<p>It may be helpful to generate random numbers in test cases.
These can be created with the function 'random([n])'. The generated number is greater
than or equal to zero and less than [n]. Considering a 16-bit multiplier as an example,
a full test can not be performed since it would have 2^32 input combinations.
A regression test that multiplies 100000 random numbers might look like this:</p>

<pre>
   A    B      Y
loop(i,100000)
  let a = random(1&lt;&lt;16);
  let b = random(1&lt;&lt;16);
  (a)  (b)   (a*b)
end loop
</pre>

<p>An input that allows high impedance as a value can also be used as a test output.
In this case, the signal name can be used with a trailing "_out" to read back and check the current value.
For this, the corresponding input must be set to high impedance ('Z').</p>

<pre>OE CLK D D_out
0   0  0 0
0   C  1 1
1   0  z 1
0   C  0 0
1   0  z 0
</pre>

<p>The circuit for this test has only one input 'D', but which can be high impedance state.
Therefore, the signal 'D_out' is also available to check the value in this case.</p>

<p>In special cases, it may be desirable to use the signals, which are provided by
the circuit, to derive a new signal, which is then tested. An example could be a bus
signal with several bits, where only a single bit should be tested, whereby the remaining
bits have no influence on the test. In this case, a new signal can be generated in the
test itself, which contains this one bit so that tests can be defined for this bit.</p>
<p>This is done with the 'declare' statement:</p>
<pre>A B Bit

declare Bit = (Bus>>3)&1;

0 0  0
0 1  0
1 0  1
1 1  0
</pre>
<p>In this example, the 3rd bit is isolated from the 'Bus' signal and made available as
the 'Bit' signal for the test. The circuit itself contains no output 'Bit'.</p>
<h3>Functions</h3>
<p>Available functions are:
<dl>
<dt>signExt([bits],[value])</dt>
<dd>Extends the value [value] while preserving the sign to [bits] bits.</dd>
<dt>random([max])</dt>
<dd>Returns an integer random number. The maximum value is specified with [max].</dd>
<dt>ite([cond],[then],[else])</dt>
<dd>If the condition [cond] is true, the value [then] is returned, otherwise the value [else].</dd>
</dl>
</p>

<h3>Processors</h3>
<p>If processors are to be tested, an initialization of the processor is usually required.
It is possible to perform this initialization within the test case.
In this way, several tests can be located in one circuit and each test can use its own initialization.
There are three instructions to perform this initialization:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 'program' statement can be used to overwrite the program memory of the processor.
The instruction <pre>program(0x8000,0x2d11,0x8000,0x2f21)</pre> writes four words to the beginning
of the program memory. All other words are set to zero.</li>.
<li>The 'memory' instruction can be used to write to a RAM component:
<pre>memory mem(3)=7;</pre>
This example writes 7 to the memory with the label 'mem' at address 3.</li>
<li> A labeled register can be overwritten with the 'init' statement.
<pre>init R0=22;</pre>
This instruction overwrites the register with the label 'R0' with the value 22.</li>
</ul>
<p>It should be noted that all used initializations are only applied once before the
test execution. It does not matter in which line in the test case these statements are located.
However, they must not be used above the header line listing the signal names.</p>.

  <h3>Interpretation of Transitions</h3>
  To simplify the generation of a deterministic automata, unconditional transitions are treated in a special way:
  an unconditional transition is only executed if no other transition satisfies the transition condition.
  So there can be an unconditional transition and conditional transitions that start in the same state.
  An unconditional transition thus determines to which state the state machine is shifted if no other transition
  condition is met.
  If there is no unconditional transition from a state, the state machine will stay in this state if no other
  transition condition is met.

    <string name="msg_graphHelp"><![CDATA[
        <html><body>
        <h3>What can be seen in the graph?</h3>
        Unlike a real logic analyzer, the X-axis of the measurement graph does not show the time.
        Instead a counter is displayed which counts the changes of state in the circuit.
        Whenever there is a change in the circuit, the counter is incremented and the new state is displayed.<br/>
        You can also think of it as a classic logic analyzer, which does not save any data for optimization
        if nothing has changed in the circuit.
        However, this also means that it is not possible to read from the graph whether a lot or little time has
        passed between two changes in the circuit.<br/>
        This behavior is caused by the nature of the simulation: The simulation of the circuit does not know the
        concept of time. A change is made to the circuit, and the change in the circuit state is calculated, until
        the circuit has stabilized again. Then the next change is made, the effect of which is also is calculated
        and so on. These changes are counted and the counter value is displayed on the X-axis of the graph.<br/>
        Among other things, this also means that a circuit cannot be overclocked, since the effects of the falling
		edge of the clock are not calculated until the circuit has stabilized after the previous rising edge.
